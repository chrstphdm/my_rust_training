# Rust Training Repository

Welcome to my personal Rust training repository!  
This project gathers a collection of self-contained examples and experiments to explore various Rust concepts.

## ðŸ§  Why this repo?

Coming from almost two decades in bioinformatics, scripting in Bash, Perl, AWK (love it !!) and Groovy (have to confess, that's mostly because of Nextflow), with a background in Java and even some C/C++ from the early days - I've always been juggling between pragmatism and performance.

Rust caught my eye not just because it's trendy, but because it promises safety, speed, and expressiveness without the footguns of C or the bloat of Java.

I don't trust Python for anything that needs real optimisation (and R even less - let's not talk about it ðŸ« ), so it was about time I learned a *real* languageâ„¢.
This repo is where I experiment, fail, and eventually make peace with the borrow checker.

## Repository Structure

Each numbered directory corresponds to a Rust concept or theme (e.g. variables, expressions, loops, enums, etc.).  
Inside each folder, you'll typically find a `main.rs` file illustrating the key ideas.

Example:
```
1.variables/
â””â”€â”€ main.rs

2.expressions/
â””â”€â”€ main.rs

3.boucles/
â””â”€â”€ main.rs

...
```

This modular structure makes it easy to focus on specific topics independently.

## Running an Example

You can run any example using `cargo run` inside the corresponding folder.  
Make sure each folder is initialized as a separate binary crate (with its own `Cargo.toml`) or adjust accordingly if using a workspace.

```bash
cd 3.boucles
cargo run
```
